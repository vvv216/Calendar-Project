Please run the program with qt 6.2.1.

Then please save the file “city.json” and “config.json”, into the build path of this project when you try to compile. If you are using Qt Creator, please save them into the folder “build-weatherKalendar-Desktop_Qt_6_2_1_GCC_64bit-Debug”

If this is the first time you compile this project with Qt Creator and you didn’t use the build path folder we provided. The first compiler might have crashed. But the “build-weatherKalendar-Desktop_Qt_6_2_1_GCC_64bit-Debug” folder should be created. Just save two .json files into this build path file, the next compile should be good.

The Weather api we are using is from https://dev.qweather.com/en/docs/api/
